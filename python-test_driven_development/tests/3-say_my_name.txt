```say_my_name```
-----------------

This module prints 'My name is ', followed by the first input `first_name` and second input `last_name`.

Usage
-----

```say_my_name(first_name, last_name="")``` prints 'My name is ', followed by `first_name`, following a space, then `last_name`.
If there wasn't an input specified for `last_name`, it defaults to "".

::

	>>> say_my_name = __import__('3-say_my_name').say_my_name
	>>> say_my_name("Holberton", "School")
	My name is Holberton School

::

	>>> say_my_name("Henry")
	My name is Henry 

Notice the space after 'Henry', this happens if a last name was not specified.
::

	>>> say_my_name("1", "2")
	My name is 1 2

As long as the input type is a string, no error are raised.
